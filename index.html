      <p>Obesity is a severe public health issue in the US, where currently, one in three U.S. adults is obese. It is known to cause heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes and certain types of cancer.

Our goal is to help obesity policy and program decision makers in planning and allocating federal budgets to various food assistance programs.</p>
